# Precision Agriculture Greenhouse Dataset

## Overview
This repository provides an **open-access dataset** collected from a controlled greenhouse environment at the **University of Ngaoundéré, Cameroon**. The data was gathered as part of a study on precision agriculture, leveraging **Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)** to monitor key environmental and network parameters.

## Dataset Features
The dataset includes measurements of:
- **Temperature (°C)**
- **Ambient Humidity (%)**
- **Soil Moisture (%)**
- **Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)**

Data was collected across **four scenarios** using two wireless communication technologies:
1. **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**: Known for its energy efficiency.
2. **WiFi (ESP-NOW)**: Optimized for low-energy, connectionless communication.

### Collection Details
- **Location**: Greenhouse, University of Ngaoundéré, Cameroon.
- **Collection Period**: 48 hours per scenario.
- **Sampling Frequency**: Every 30 minutes.
- **Format**: CSV files, easy to integrate into data pipelines.
